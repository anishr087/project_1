This project is designed to provide a user-friendly, multi-functional calculator with modes such as Simple, Scientific, Currency, and Unit Conversion. The main aim of this project is to learn and apply file handling techniques, particularly for managing user credentials. Developed as part of the Programming and Data Structures course, the calculator features an intuitive interface that allows users to easily navigate between different modes through numeric inputs. In addition, the project includes a secure login and registration system, which enhances the user experience by securely storing and validating credentials. This ensures data integrity and privacy, making the application both reliable and efficient for end users.
